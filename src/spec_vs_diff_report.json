The diff only shows a Footer change (including a hardcoded logo asset path) and does not show the required static asset replacement in frontend/public/assets/generated nor the Discord link update across the site. The Footer also adds new caffeine.ai attribution/UTM behavior that was not requested.",

      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Replace the current static images used for the site logo and the hero/banner background with the user-uploaded image(s) by placing the uploaded artwork into the existing asset paths and filenames already referenced by the UI (so no code changes are required for the swap).",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any changes under frontend/public/assets/generated (where the images must be served from) and does not show any hero/banner background image swap. Only a Footer component change is shown, which is insufficient to verify the required asset replacement and hero background rendering.",
