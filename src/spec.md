# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the site’s branding assets to the user-uploaded Cooper SMP artwork and ensure the Discord link points to the provided invite URL.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the existing static hero/banner background image at `/assets/generated/cooper-smp-hero-bg.dim_1920x800.png` with the chosen user-uploaded banner artwork (served as a static file).
- Replace the existing static site logo image at `/assets/generated/cooper-smp-logo.dim_512x512.png` with the chosen user-uploaded logo artwork (served as a static file).
- Ensure all Discord links across the site (including the Contact section Discord button) point to `https://discord.gg/coopersmp` and open in a new tab.

**User-visible outcome:** The site displays the new Cooper SMP logo and hero banner artwork on desktop and mobile without broken image links, and the Discord button/link takes users to `https://discord.gg/coopersmp` in a new tab.
